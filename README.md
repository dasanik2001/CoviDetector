##### *CoviDetector: A Transfer Learning-based Semi Supervised Approach to detect Covid-19 using CXR Images*

Code for this project is accessible on [Github](https://github.com/dasanik2001/CoviDetector)

### Features
- Application Prototype for the proposed study on COVID-19 Classification. 
- Built using the Semi-Supervised Learning and Transfer Learning models trained on Several Datasets.
- The user will be able to upload the Chest X-Ray and the app will be diagnosing with the help of Deep Learning. 
- Supported on Android. iOS support will be available soon. 

### How to use the application
1. Download or clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dasanik2001/CoviDetector.git
cd CoviDetectorApp
```
2. Open CoviDetector in Android Studio.
3. Build the project & run either on a simulator or a physical android device.

### Data
The Datasets for this study are acquired from the following:
1. [COVID CXR Image Dataset (Research)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/covid-cxr-image-dataset-research) 
2. [DLAI3 Hackathon Phase3 COVID-19 CXR Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanchan/dlai3-hackathon-phase3-covid19-cxr-challenge) 
3. [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) 
4. [Covid19 Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/donjon00/covid19-detection) 

### Highlights
- CoviDetector is new semi-supervised approach based on transfer learning & clustering.
- CoviDetector generates models with improved accuracy and require less training data.
- CXR images are given to the deep learning model to evaluate CoviDetector.
- CoviDetector utilizes the GradCam to interpret the output in a graphical form.
- Developed an Android app to offer a user-friendly interface.
